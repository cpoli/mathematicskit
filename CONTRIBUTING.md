# Contributing to mathematicskit

Thanks for considering a contribution. mathematicskit is organized as one
subpackage per mathematics domain (`mathematicskit/<name>/`), each with its own
`core/` (ABCs and shared engine machinery, plus kernels JIT-compiled
by numba, when it is installed, where needed), `systems/` (concrete models/algorithms), `utils/`
(supporting numerics), `visualizers/` (matplotlib plotting), and
`tests/` directory. New mathematics belongs in the subpackage it fits
best; a genuinely new domain gets its own subpackage following the same
layout.

## Setup

```bash
python -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -e ".[dev]"
pre-commit install
```

## Before opening a PR

```bash
ruff check .                 # lint
ruff format .                # format
MPLBACKEND=Agg pytest -q     # unit tests
MPLBACKEND=Agg pytest --doctest-modules mathematicskit --ignore-glob="*/tests/*"   # docstring examples
```

All three run in CI (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) on every PR, across
Python 3.10-3.14 on Linux and macOS. `mypy` also runs in CI and must
pass — see "Type checking" below.

If you touch anything under `docs/` or add/modify an example in
`examples/`, also build the docs locally before opening a PR (this
re-executes every changed `examples/*/plot_*.py` script via
sphinx-gallery, which is the only way to catch a broken example):

```bash
pip install -e ".[docs]"
cd docs && make html
```

## Code style

- Follow the existing style in the subpackage you're editing —
  mathematical notation (`n`, `k`, `x`, single-letter variables) is
  intentional and allowed (see the `ruff` ignores in `pyproject.toml` for
  the specific, deliberate exceptions).
- Every public function/class gets a NumPy-style docstring with a
  `Parameters`, `Returns`, and (where it adds real value beyond what the
  signature already says) an `Examples` section with a runnable doctest.
  Doctests are checked in CI — a docstring example that doesn't actually
  run is worse than no example.
- Prefer closed-form / analytically-verifiable results in tests
  (`pytest.approx` against a known formula) over snapshot-testing plot
  output.
- New algorithms should cite where the result/formula comes from (a
  textbook name/edition or a paper), either in the docstring or as a
  comment, so a reader can verify it independently.
- Call `numpy`/`scipy` directly for anything they already implement
  (decompositions, eigensolvers, linear/iterative solvers, root finders,
  quadrature, FFT, statistical distributions, optimization routines,
  etc.) rather than reimplementing it — mathematicskit's value-add is its own
  dataclass-result API, docstrings, visualizers, tests, and examples
  wrapped around those calls, not reinventing numerical primitives that
  are already correct and well-tested upstream. Only hand-write an
  algorithm from scratch when it has **no numpy/scipy equivalent at
  all** (e.g. Dijkstra/Kruskal/Ford-Fulkerson and other graph
  algorithms, the simplex method, integer-partition/Stirling-number
  combinatorics, modular-arithmetic number theory, finite-field/
  group-table abstract algebra, cellular automata, and other genuinely
  from-scratch discrete algorithms), or when the algorithm itself is the
  pedagogical subject of a `systems/` module (e.g. exposing a root
  finder's or gradient descent's full per-iterate history for a
  convergence-rate comparison, even though `scipy.optimize` could solve
  the same problem in one call). When in doubt, prefer the library call.
  No hard dependency on `networkx`, `cvxpy`, or SageMath. `sympy` may be
  used sparingly inside *tests* for symbolic cross-checks, never as the
  runtime engine behind a public API.

## Type checking

`mypy` is configured in `pyproject.toml` and `mypy mathematicskit` is
clean; CI fails on any new type error. Function bodies without
annotations are not checked (`check_untyped_defs = false`), so annotate
new public functions to get them checked.

## Tests

Tests live alongside each subpackage (`mathematicskit/<name>/tests/`), not in a
top-level `tests/` directory. A new system/model needs:

- At least one test that checks a closed-form / analytically-known
  result, not just "it runs without crashing."
- A visualizer needs only a smoke test (it returns the right type/shape,
  and — for animations — that `anim.save()` to a temp file succeeds).
- numba is optional (the `fast` extra). Import `njit` from
  `mathematicskit._jit`, never from `numba` directly, so the kernel still
  runs as plain Python without numba, and CI's no-numba job still passes.
  A test that is only practical with the JIT (minutes of pure-Python
  loops) may be marked
  `@pytest.mark.skipif(not HAS_NUMBA, reason=...)`.

## API stability and deprecation policy

mathematicskit is in **beta** (`Development Status :: 4 - Beta`) and
follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/). The public API is
every name listed in a subpackage's `__all__`, reached as
`mk.<subpackage>.<name>` or `mathematicskit.<subpackage>.<name>`,
including the fields of result dataclasses. Modules and names whose
path contains a leading underscore (for example
`mathematicskit._jit`), and anything under `core/`, `systems/`, or
`utils/` that isn't re-exported by its subpackage, are internal.

- **Patch releases (0.x.Y)** fix bugs only. They never change a public
  signature or a result field.
- **Minor releases (0.X.0)** may add to the public API. A public name,
  parameter, or result field is removed or renamed only after a
  deprecation period: for at least one minor release it keeps working
  and emits a `DeprecationWarning` that names its replacement, and the
  change is listed under "Deprecated" in `CHANGELOG.md`.
- **Numerical results** may change within tolerance in any release when
  an algorithm is made more accurate or robust. Changes beyond round-off
  are noted in the changelog.
- **1.0** will freeze the public API. After that, removals happen only in
  major releases.

## Releasing

1. Bump `__version__` in `mathematicskit/__init__.py` (`pyproject.toml`
   reads the version from there) and `version`/`date-released` in
   `CITATION.cff`, and move the `CHANGELOG.md` "Unreleased" entries under
   a new `## [X.Y.Z] - YYYY-MM-DD` section. Regenerate the README figures
   (`python docs/make_readme_figure.py`,
   `python docs/make_readme_subpackage_figures.py`) if their code changed.
2. Merge to `main`, then push a tag `vX.Y.Z` on that commit:

   ```bash
   git tag vX.Y.Z && git push origin vX.Y.Z
   ```

   That is the only manual step. `.github/workflows/release.yml` checks
   that the tag matches the built distributions, `CITATION.cff` and a
   CHANGELOG section; uploads to PyPI through trusted publishing (no API
   token); creates the GitHub Release with the CHANGELOG section as its
   notes (Zenodo then archives it with a DOI); and deploys the docs to
   `gh-pages`. The one-time setup on PyPI, GitHub and Zenodo is described
   in the workflow's header comment.

## History entries

`docs/source/history/*_breakthroughs.rst` is a curated chronology per
domain, not a general-purpose list of "interesting math history." Each
entry exists because it connects to something this package actually
implements. Keep it that way:

- A new entry must cite the concrete class/method it connects to
  (`:meth:`.../:class:`...` cross-reference) and belongs in the same PR
  as the implementation it describes, not added on its own.
- One entry per PR. If you're adding several related pieces of math,
  open separate PRs (or ask first) rather than batching a set of history
  entries together.
- Changes to `docs/source/history/**` require a maintainer review
  (enforced via `.github/CODEOWNERS`) even if the rest of the PR is
  otherwise approved.

## Reporting bugs / requesting features

Open a GitHub issue. For a mathematics bug specifically, include the
formula or reference you expected the code to match, and (if possible)
the numeric discrepancy — "this doesn't look right" is much slower to act
on than "the interpolation should be exact for a degree-3 polynomial at 4
nodes and I'm getting a residual of X."
