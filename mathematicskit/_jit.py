"""Optional Numba acceleration.

Numba is an optional dependency (``pip install mathematicskit[fast]``).
When it is installed, :func:`njit` is :func:`numba.njit`. When it is not
(including in Pyodide/JupyterLite, where Numba cannot run), :func:`njit`
is a no-op decorator: every kernel runs as plain Python/NumPy with
identical results, only slower. Both call forms are supported --
``@njit`` and ``@njit(cache=True)`` -- so decorated code never needs to
know which is in use.

Examples
--------
>>> from mathematicskit.integrators import njit
>>> @njit
... def square(x):
...     return x * x
>>> square(3.0)
9.0
